# the idea is to scan for future rittenhouse's, and notify activists of immanent danger to life
# ultimately I decided to move on from this project and instead implement OpenAI's API to automate the classification of tweets

<h1>Scan articles and categorize them based on training data. </h1>

<p>

This is a personal project I started to learn web scraping to create a data set and practice building an application with real world utility -- to . I want to train an AI model on potential domestic terrorist accounts in America. I plan to scrape Twitter and Gab for death threats, for accounts that idealize and promote violence, for accounts that belonged to known criminals, and for accounts posting gore.</p>

<h2>Plans for the future:</h2>

<p>
for end user:
0. Plan out categorization for data
0.1. Choose geolocation to surveil
  
for project:
1. Scrape Twitter
2. Scrape Gab
3. Train model to save tweets, tweet metadata, username, and user-id of users who post pro-violent content in general or promote violence against minorities, glorify or encourage violence against protesters and those who seek bodily autonomy or cultural sovereignty against colonialism and imperialism, small businesses
3.1. Train model to detect ownership of firearms, 
4. Automate the mapping of social networks for social hate groups [blue/all lives matter, patriot front, 3 percenters, proud boys]
5. Automate hourly web scraping to search for new intel
6. Find a way to notify user of immenent threat to public safety
